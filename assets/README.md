# js-assessment
Assessment Details:
In this assignment i have created an interactive quiz based off of a topic i enjoy.
When loaded youll be welcomed to a quiz you can submit your initials and your score will be logged once the quiz is over. To begin click the start button. A timer of 40 seconds will begin counting down until all questions are answered or the timer hits zero. When either of the criteria are met then the page will display your current score. If a question is answered incorrectly then the timer will be subtracted by 5. I included a small bit of CSS to add color and a small amount of style to the page. In addition i linked the Js file to some picture to have a few visuals while answering questions.
